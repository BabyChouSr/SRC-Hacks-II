# SRC Hacks II
PROJECT: Foodology
## Inspiration
Our friend, Renesh Gudipati, is allergic to nuts. A distinct memory that inspired us to create this application is a time when he was five years old. He was at a Chinese restaurant, oblivious of the extremely different text. As a young kid, he couldn't understand the chinese language and just ate whatever was given to him. He was immediately sent to the emergency hospital, face filled with rashes and esophagus closing in as he was rushed to the hospital. Through this experience, we had the revelation that we often don't know what we are eating, left in the shadows. That's why we created Foodology, to create a versatile tool to allow anyone to traverse through any language, to eat anything they want safely. 
## What it does
It detects images from different foods and analyzes them through databases to determine the effects of certain foods as well as translates the text into English for the reader. 
## How we built it
It utilizes Google Cloud Platform API and detects images and analyzes the words on it. We also utilized Google's Text-Translate API to convert the languages. 
We then utilize a database in order to classify the ingredients in different categories regarding the different possible effects such as cancer, diabetes, headaches, etc. 
After that, we utilized Flask in order to link the website with the frontend (html,js,css) with the backend (python). This way, many others can utilize our application.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some problems regarding the creation of the app.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Object Detection through Deep Learning (GCP API), Flask With the Front End, Helping the world encountering similar problems
## What we learned
We learned that coding has a much larger impact than we first expected. The world can be benefitted incredibly through our program. Obesity levels drop, diabetes levels drop, and mortality levels drop. We also learned how to skillfully use Flask and GCP API
## What's next for Foodology
Future Rollout includes putting the application on the app-store and to get a hosting website for it.
